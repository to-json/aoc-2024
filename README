# AOC 2024

i don't usually do AOC, and when i do, i don't usually post it to github

this year tho, i have like 10 languages i wanna try for different stuff,
and aoc makes a good playground. so, gonna do at least a few days of it,
and a different language as often as i feel like. some that made the list:

jank
babashka
janet
guile
fennel
hy
sbcl
v
d
rust (free space)
hare
gleam
odin
io
smalltalk
ocaml
sml
nushell
go (:/)
typescript (://)
python (free space 2)

idk if i'll hit all of these, or any of them. this is playtime for me, if
it doesn't seem fun at the time i just wont.
