# Day 1: Hare

Been meaning to fuck with hare since like 2 years ago when
I saw Drew on some youtube channel introducing it. 100 year language,
"better c", bold decisions (no concurrency prims?! no closed source OSes?!)

It's good. Lotta ceremony for a string processing toy app, but, it's
super fast, and basically toolless (Nvim comes with some formatting,
but I had no lsp or anything pleasant), which feels very good to me.
Satisfying in a "I'm very old, online" sort of way. The haredoc cli
command is especially appreciated; every language should have this,
if Hare's sole legacy is making this a norm Drew will have won.

Error handling is nice, `!` for "fuck you, do it anyway" is real good.
Tagged unions that include non-errors are a bit of a trip bc the language
doesn't really help you, yet, but it worked out. I think when it's better
documented, it could be a really lovely tool for systems work, and it
makes me curious to see where helios goes.

## how does i run yr shit

- Install hare according to the docs (this includes: use linux)
- in the project root: `hare build cmd/1.ha`; `hare build cmd/2.ha`
- `./1` ; `./2`
